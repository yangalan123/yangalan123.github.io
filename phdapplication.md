<ul>
     <li>I deeply understand how difficult it is to get an NLP Ph.D. offer in US for international students. I have released my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n_xcJNVPmhMSrxbQLF9TunXJ9ZM12Mm_/view?usp=sharing">Statement-of-Purpose</a> at <a href="https://cs-sop.org/">cs-sop.org</a>
    <li>In 2021, I have also created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15Wl3c3Jl-Q1CHd1Zbd7DnpuId-VMZajbF34Wi-rJXTg/edit?usp=sharing">target school list</a> with friends applying for CS Ph.D. program together. It includes deadline and requirements for application materials. Although it is outdated, but usually universities do not change their policies that much and we have included the link to the detailed policy. </li>
     <li>I have mentored, collaborated and advised many great students applying for ML/NLP Ph.D. It turns out they all go to places better than me :-). Proud for them! </li>   
    </li>   
    <li>If you are an undergraduate / master student at UChicago and interested in working with me, please contact my advisors (mostly because I cannot personally write you a recommendation letter lol, but happy to just chat about research!). </li>
    </ul>
