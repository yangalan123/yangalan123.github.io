subtitle: Nice to meet you! Here is my self-introduction.

My name is Chenghao Yang. I am currently an Master student and Research Assistant at Columbia University. I am fortunately supervised by [Prof. Smaranda Muresan](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smara/). I also keep close connection with [Prof. Jason Eisner](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/) at Johns Hopkins University, [Prof. Zhiyuan Liu](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/) at Tsinghua University and[Dr. Mo Yu](https://sites.google.com/site/moyunlp/) at IBM Research.

My research interest focuses on natural language processing (NLP), knowledge graph (KG), and information retrieval (IR). My goal is to design practical NLP system as well understand the underlying human intelligence behind the natural language. Recently, I worked on word-level semantics and robustness. 

In my personal spare time, I enjoy listening to music, playing the guitar, watching the movie and the anime. I recently become fascinated by cooking Chinese dishes. 

### Research Experience

When I was an undergraduate at Beihang University, out of my interest of NLP, I visited Tsinghua University and was fortunately supervised by [Prof. Zhiyuan Liu](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/). At Tsinghua, I mainly worked on the application of the KG over NLP and learned the basics about NLP and ML as well as the elemental research skills such as how to analyze the data and design the models. I published two long papers at ACL during my internship at Tsinghua, [one](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1571/) on semantic compositionality (2nd author), and the other [one](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.540/) on robustness (co-1st-author, although it is published only after I leave Tsinghua). Achieving the balance between course study and research was defintely difficult for me, but I finally managed that and my outstanding academic performance won me [Shenyuan Medal Nomination Award](https://news.buaa.edu.cn/info/1010/47086.htm), the supreme honor for undergradautes at Beihang University.

After I completed my B.Eng at Beihang, I came to Columbia University as a Master student. I just found that there were so many good opportunities for research collaboration, which was quite exciting and pushed my research into next stage. My first collaboration project at US was over social media data processing and I was advised by [Prof. Smaranda Muresan](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smara/) and [Prof. Nabila El-Bassel](https://socialwork.columbia.edu/faculty-research/faculty/full-time/nabila-el-bassel/). We digged out the need for marginal community during the terrible COVID-19 pandemic using unsupervised topic modeling and designed the corresponding guideline. During my summer internship at IBM Watson, I was mentored by [Dr. Mo Yu](https://sites.google.com/site/moyunlp/) on narrative QA project, which aimed at answering questions from narrative text (e.g., novels or movie scripts). [Our joint work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09878) was published on NUSE @ ACL 2020. 

Besides, I also worked with [Prof. Jason Eisner](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/) and his PhD advisee [Hongyuan Mei](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~hmei/) on continuous event stream modeling. I will start my visiting research assistant at JHU during Spring 2021.
