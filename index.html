<div class="text-center">
    <p>My name is Chenghao Yang. I am currently an Master student and Research Assistant at Columbia University.
        I am fortunately supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smara/">Prof. Smaranda Muresan</a>.
        I also keep close connection with <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/">Prof. Jason Eisner</a> at Johns
        Hopkins University,
        <a href="http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/">Prof. Zhiyuan Liu</a> at Tsinghua University and
        <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/moyunlp/">Dr. Mo Yu</a> at IBM Research.</p>
    <p>My research interest focuses on natural language processing (NLP), knowledge graph (KG), and information
        retrieval (IR).
        My goal is to design practical NLP system as well understand the underlying human intelligence behind the
        natural language.
        Recently, I worked on word-level semantics and robustness. </p>
    
    <p>In my personal spare time, I enjoy listening to music, playing the guitar, watching the movie and the anime.
        I recently become fascinated by cooking Chinese dishes. </p>
