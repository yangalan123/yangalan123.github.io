<div>
    <p>My name is Chenghao Yang. I am currently an applied scientist at AWS AI, supervised by <a href="https://www.andrewoarnold.com/">Prof. Andrew O. Arnold. </a></p>
    <p>
        I also worked as unpaid part-time RAs at Johns Hopkins University 
        (advised by <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/">Prof. Jason Eisner</a>).     
        <!-- I am fortunately . -->
        I keep close connections with 
        <!-- with  at Johns
        Hopkins University, -->
        <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smara/">Prof. Smaranda Muresan</a> at Columbia University, 
        <a href="http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/">Prof. Zhiyuan Liu</a> at Tsinghua University and
        <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/moyunlp/">Dr. Mo Yu</a> at IBM Research.</p>

    <p>Before I join AWS, I obtained my M.S. degree in Computer Science Department at Columbia University (ML track) 
        and my bachelor's degree in Software College, Beihang University.</p>

    <p>My research interest focuses on natural language processing (NLP), knowledge graph (KG), and information
        retrieval (IR).
        My goal is to design practical NLP systems as well as understand the underlying human intelligence behind the
        natural language.
        Recently, I worked on word-level semantics, robustness, Question-Answering and continuous-time event stream modeling. </p>
    
    <p>I enjoy listening to music, playing the guitar, watching the movie, and the anime in my personal spare time.
        I recently become fascinated by cooking Chinese dishes. </p>
