subtitle: Welcome to my personal website!

<div>
    <p>My name is Chenghao Yang. I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at University of Chicago. I am fortunately advised by
        <a href="https://aetting.github.io/">Prof. Allyson Ettinger</a> and <a href="https://chenhaot.com/">Prof. Chenhao Tan</a>. 
        My research is generously supported supported by <a href="https://physicalsciences.uchicago.edu/academics/financial-aid/eckhardt-scholars/">Eckhardt Scholarship</a>.
    </p>
    <p>My research interest focuses on natural language processing (NLP), knowledge graph (KG), and information
        retrieval (IR).
        My goal is to design practical NLP systems as well as understand the underlying human intelligence behind the
        natural language.
        Recently, I worked on word-level semantics, robustness, question-answering and continuous-time event stream modeling. </p>
    <p>
        <!-- I also worked as RA at Johns Hopkins University  -->
        <!-- (advised by <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/">Prof. Jason Eisner</a>).      -->
        <!-- I am fortunately . -->
        I keep close connections and collaboration with my previous advisors and mentors (Great thanks!): 
        <!-- with  at Johns
        Hopkins University, -->
        <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/">Prof. Jason Eisner</a> at JHU,
        <a href="https://hhexiy.github.io/">Prof. He He</a> at NYU, 
        <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/">Prof. Kai-Wei Chang</a> at UCLA,

        <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/moyunlp/">Dr. Mo Yu</a> at Wechat Research.</p>

    <p>Before I join UChicago, I was previously an applied scientist at AWS AI, 
        under the lead of <a href="https://www.andrewoarnold.com/">Andrew O. Arnold. </a>
        My full-time work at AWS AI is mostly about building and evaluating large-scale language models for code generation. I obtained my M.S. degree in Computer Science Department at Columbia University (ML track) 
        and my bachelor's degree in Software College, Beihang University.</p>

    
    
    <p>I enjoy listening to music, playing the guitar, watching movies, and the anime in my personal spare time.
        I recently become fascinated by cooking Chinese dishes. </p>
